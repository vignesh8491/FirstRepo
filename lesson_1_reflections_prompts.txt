How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It is very useful if file size is large as it pinpoints the line where error occurs and
what error occured

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

i dont want to care about saving the previous versions of file when making changes. The system takes care of everything

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?

manually commiting will allow user to have control and helpful in dynamic content whereas auto commit is helpful if content is static

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

git works with multiple file simultaneously and all of them represent same thing. while google doc each doc is independent of another

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows all the commit and git diff changes made between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
i am safe enough to have backup of previous modifications

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
start my project

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
only initializes not commited

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
it awesome. you can add files to commit and u can commit all atonce

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
add one file at a time

When to Use Branches
